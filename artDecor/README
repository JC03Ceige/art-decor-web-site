|| Using the promo code: ||
\\=======================//

The artDeco page has a promo discount code which appears only on the first visit or unles you clear the localStorage. 
In order to use and test the promo code discount upon check-out, it is advised to start by opening the landing page first that the promo-code may be generated.
If you did not write down the promo code or lost your code, a copy of the code can be access in the localStorage and the code will also be in the console for the shopping cart page.

Enjoy your visit and happy shopping!

| Additional Notes |
|==================|

The page contains some elements that are there for design and layout purposes only and are not yet functional. Elements required for the task are however functional.

The add to cart and quick add to cart aer one and the same, the reason being that the product "page" for the website is in fact on the catalogue page and appears over the product image when selected. I am not sure if this will meet the requirements.
